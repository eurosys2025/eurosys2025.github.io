                    <p>
                        Thanks to generous donations from our supporters and sponsors, EuroSys offers several grants to
                        enable students to attend the conference and/or the collocated workshops. The grants cover the
                        cost of the registration and may also include a contribution towards accommodation and travel
                        expenses. Grants will be issued as a refund after the event.
                    </p>

                    <p> Kindly refrain from applying for both an ASPLOS grant and a EuroSys grant. Only one application
                        is permitted.
                    </p>
