Athens is a vibrant metropolis, the cradle of Western civilization!
Take the opportunity to explore ancient wonders, like the Acropolis and the Parthenon, savor delicious Greek cuisine in lively tavernas, and immerse yourself in the culture of this historic city.
A short list of places to visit follows, however, the possibilities are endless for the more adventurous!

<h3 class="section-heading">The Acropolis</h3>
<img src="img/athens_acropolis.jpg" name="Acropolis" align="left" hspace="12" width="192" height="128" border="0"/>
The Acropolis is located on a flattish-topped rock that rises 150 ft above sea level in the city of Athens,
with a surface area of about 3 hectares (7.4 acres).

The Parthenon, the hallmark of ancient Greek civilization, is indeed the most imposing of all.
It is the most magnificent creation of Athenian democracy at the height of its power.
Parthenon, a monument that constitutes the symbol of Greece worldwide, has been standing on the “sacred rock” of Athens, the Acropolis, for thousands of years.
The Parthenon, along with other monuments of the Acropolis, are all excellent pieces of art, reflecting the Classical period and the
Golden Age of ancient Greece in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> centuries B.C.


<h3 class="section-heading">The Acropolis Museum</h3>
<img src="img/athens_acropolis_museum_1.jpg" name="Acropolis Museum" align="right" hspace="12" width="187" height="135" border="0"/>
The museum is located by the southeastern slope of the Acropolis hill, on
the ancient road that led up to the &quot;sacred rock&quot; in
classical times. Set only 280 meters, away from the Parthenon,
and a 400 meters walking distance from it, the museum is the largest
modern building erected so close to the ancient site.

<img src="img/athens_acropolis_museum_2.jpg" name="Acropolis Museum" align="left" hspace="12" width="187" height="135" border="0"/>
The Acropolis Museum is consistently rated as one of the best museums in
the world. Devoted to the <b>Parthenon</b> and
its surrounding temples, it is cleverly perched above Athens like a
luminous box. The large glass panes beautifully draw in the ancient
and modern parts of the city, making it a truly evocative experience.
Designed by New York’s, Bernard Tschumi, with local Greek
architect Michael Photiadis, it is the perfect sanctuary for
the ancient artefacts that were found in and around the Acropolis and successfully
deconstructs how the <b>Parthenon sculptures</b> once
looked to the citizens of ancient Athens.

<h3 class="section-heading">Odeon of Herodes Atticus</h3>
<img src="img/athens_herodeum.jpg" name="Herodeum" align="right" hspace="12" width="211" height="141" border="0"/>
One of the legendary sites that sits beneath the slopes of the Acropolis
on the southwest side, is the stunning open-air theatre, Odeon of
Herodes Atticus. When Pausanias, the Greek traveller and geographer
from the second century AD, visited Athens during the reign of Marcus
Aurelius, he described the Odeon theatre as "the finest building".

<h3 class="section-heading">Panathinaikon Stadium</h3>
<img src="img/athens_panathinaikon.jpg" name="Panathinaikon" align="left" hspace="12" width="212" height="132" border="0"/>
The <b>Panathinaikon Stadium</b> or <b>Kallimarmaro</b> (&quot;beautiful marble&quot;) is a multi-purpose stadium
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" target="Athens"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none">Athens</a>, Greece.
It is the only stadium in the world built entirely of marble.
It hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the first modern Olympics in 1896.
It was used for various purposes in the 20th century and was once again
used as an Olympic venue in 2004. It is the finishing point for the
annual Athens Classic Marathon. It is also the last venue in
Greece from where the Olympic flame handover ceremony to
the host nation takes place.

<h3 class="section-heading">National Archaeological Museum of Athens</h3>
<img src="img/athens_archaeological_museum.jpg" name="Panathinaikon" align="right" hspace="12" width="212" height="132" border="0"/>
The National Archaeological Museum of Athens is the largest archaeological museum in Greece and one of the most important museums in the world devoted to ancient Greek art.

<h3 class="section-heading">Ancient Agora</h3>
<img src="img/athens_ancient_agora.jpg" name="Ancient Agora" align="left" hspace="12" width="212" height="132" border="0"/>
The ancient Agora of Athens (also called the Classical Agora) is the best-known example of an ancient Greek agora, located to the northwest of the Acropolis and bounded on the south by the hill of the Areopagus and on the west by the hill known as the Agoraios Kolonos, also called Market Hill.
