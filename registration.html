                    <h3><strong>General Conditions</strong></h3>



                    <p>The 2025 edition of EuroSys/ASPLOS will be a physical event only (no online
                        participation/registration will be considered). All participants must acknowledge the ACM
                        Privacy Policy: <a
                            href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/privacy-policy">https://www.acm.org/about-acm/privacy-policy</a>
                        and the ACM policy against harassment: <a

                    </p>

                    <p>At least one full (non-student) conference registration fee (ACM/EuroSys member or
                        non-member) is required for each paper accepted at the EuroSys/ASPLOS conference, even if
                        the author is eligible for a student fee or has paid the fee already for another paper
                        (i.e., a full registration is valid only for a single paper). At least one author for each
                        paper accepted at the conference must register before March 17th, 2025. At least one
                        workshop/tutorial registration fee (student or non-student, as appropriate) is required for
                        each paper/presentation accepted at a workshop/tutorial.</p>
