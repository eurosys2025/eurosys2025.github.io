                    <b>Notice:</b> The EuroSys'25 Shadow PC will only run through the EuroSys'25 Fall deadline.

                    </p>
                    Eurosys is organising a shadow program committee for the EuroSys 2025 conference under the sponsorship of EuroSys.
                    If you are interested in participating, please apply online at <a href="https://framaforms.org/eurosys-2025-shadow-pc-1715331262">https://framaforms.org/eurosys-2025-shadow-pc-1715331262</a> until 31 October 2024 AoE.
                    You will be requested to complete the application form, and attach your CV.
                    Please also get in touch if you have any questions at <a href="mailto:shadow-2025@eurosys.org">shadow-2025@eurosys.org</a>.

                  <h2>Why join a Shadow PC?</h2>
                    The EuroSys Shadow PC is a great opportunity for junior researchers to gain experience of the review and program committee process and for authors to obtain additional feedback on their work.
                    Shadow PC reviews will have no effect on the decisions of the EuroSys PC, but Shadow PC members will be able to see the submitted papers and obtain real-life experience on how submissions to a top conference look like.
                    Author identities and the regular PC reviews/comments from the EuroSys PC will remain, of course, invisible to the Shadow PC.
                    The reviews written by the Shadow PC members will only be visible to the Shadow PC members and eventually to the authors.

                    </p>
                    Serving as a member of a Shadow PC is a lot of work.
                    But, besides the recognition of being selected, it is also worthwhile for a number of reasons, including:
                    <ul>
                            <li>Getting to know how an academic PC is run and how it operates;</li>
                            <li>Seeing how more experienced reviewers judge the same papers that you review;</li>
                            <li>Getting to see both strong and weak papers at the submission stage;</li>
                            <li>Discovering what it takes to publish a paper in a highly selective conference, such as EuroSys;</li>
                            <li>Having a chance to read top-notch papers in your area of expertise before they are published;</li>
                            <li>Getting to know other young researchers who are also selected to the Shadow PC.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2>How does the Shadow PC work?</h2>
						  Shadow PC
                    members must commit themselves to writing their own detailed and
                    rigorous reviews for papers assigned to them by the allotted
                    deadlines. This timely review commitment is essential to the good
                    functioning of the Shadow PC. Candidates who might be unable to
                    fulfill their reviewing duties should refrain from applying. 

                    We expect a review load of 5-8 papers altogether per member in two
                    reviewing rounds. Members will not be expected to take part in a
                    rebuttal stage. Shadow PC members are also expected to attend at
                    a short pre-PC meeting, during which the exact PC instructions will
                    be discussed with the PC chairs, plus a one-day discussion meeting,
                    during which the final acceptance/rejection of papers will be discussed.
                    Both meetings will be organized online. Shadow PC members
                    will be required to comply with ethical code of conduct. 

                    <h2>How to become a Shadow PC member</h2>
                    You will need to submit your application via the Eurosys Shadow PC submission site: <a href="https://framaforms.org/eurosys-2025-shadow-pc-1715331262">https://framaforms.org/eurosys-2025-shadow-pc-1715331262</a>.
                    You will need to complete the submission form and attach in form of a single pdf following information:

                            <li>Short motivation letter (not more than 300 words);</li>
                            <li>Your CV (as an 1-2 page PDF document)</li>
                             <ul>
                                      <li>In case you are a PhD student: Please provide a short support statement from your supervisor/advisor as an additional page at the end of your CV.
                                      <li>In case you are a Post-Doc or Junior Faculty: please highlight in your CV what (if any) reviewing experience you already have.
                             </ul>
                    </ul>


                    With your submission you will commit to the principles and standards of ethical conduct of research integrity as defined by ACM.
